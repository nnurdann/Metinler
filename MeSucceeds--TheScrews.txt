The Screws

I ***quants *** my own breath
And I steamed out from much too long
And I long **father wrong** of yours
And I hated under the same as well

And your throwghts is not worth anywords
**It's sobe and **sorrow
and it's pain me listening to your voice.
I'd just like to cut it off

And I have already seen to much
Although I haven't seen anything yet
And I loose touch to my own aprehension
And I loose touch to what I wants got
And my hands are not worth any word
They better should do nothing at all
And I rather sleep on them
Till there are ***stand
Before they waked up with the will of th'hero.

And this time is not worth any word
We can't take influence on anything
And decisions are made in higher position
That are not really worth to reach

And so we gravel along this *pader of machinery
Out of control and overheated
It gives us the feeling we are needless
And no one take the *can/con* of us

But we are the screws
Holding it together
We are the screws you can't *** ???
Give us the responsability with **??? (fat)
At least, it's at us if we take it or not (tentatively)
But we are the screws
Holding it together
We are the screws you can't ignore
Tell me the importance the ***???
And I will decide that I just can't take more
